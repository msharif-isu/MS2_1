Fixing today’s friend-finding apps

## Description
- Create an account
  - Get assigned a unique account on the database that can be logged in from any device
  - Accounts will have a username and password to log in
- Link your spotify account
  - Use last fm api to get the user's specific music data
- Add people with similar interests
  - Users will be shown other users with similar musical interest and can be “added”
- Block people
  - If you block someone, they will be removed from your friends list (if they’re in it) and you will also not be suggested as a friend
- Message other users who’ve added you back
  - If two users decide to add with each other, they will be able to message each other back
  - Able to group chat
